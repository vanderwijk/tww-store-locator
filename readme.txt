== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I embed the Store Locator? =

Use the new post type 'Stores' to enter the information about your store locations. Once all Store Locations are entered, type in [storelocator] in your Post or Page to embed it.

= What do I enter for the Google Coordinates? =

No need to worry about that! Just save the new Store location and it will automatically populate.

= What if it doesn't populate? =

Check the address you entered, it may have a misspelled street name or the State/Province, City and Country may not have been entered.
If your address has a Suite or Apt number at the beginning, try to type in after the street address instead.
For example 'Suite 123 45 Maple St.' can be typed as '45 Maple St. Suite 123' instead.

= Can I change the width and height of the Store Locator? =

Yes, you can do so within the shortcode - [storelocator width="650" height="700"]

= Can I style the Store Locator? =

Right now, you can do so by using the style.css file in the plugin's files folder.
